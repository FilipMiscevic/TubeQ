# TubeQ
TubeQ is a tube distortion simulator implemented using the Webaudio API.

It is based on the principle that most of the audible distortion attributable to tube amps derives from the phenomenon of resonance, which results in an arithmetic sequence of overtones of the fundamental frequency. The user can specify the fundamental frequency, and the amplitude of each overtone can be tuned manually or automatically using the universal resonance curve.
